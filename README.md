# Space Traders C Bot

This is a bot that seeks to optimally play the [Space Traders](https://spacetraders.io/) game. I wrote it in C because I thought it would be interesting, and I wanted to try writing my own JSON parser in C.

Parser is done, basic CLI is done, can register a new agent and set up authorization with a provided token. Still needs way more parsing code for JSON to struct and also fix memory leaks.
